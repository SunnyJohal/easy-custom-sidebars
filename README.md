# Easy Custom Sidebars

Welcome to the Easy Custom Sidebars development repository.

## What is Easy Custom Sidebars?

Easy Custom Sidebars is a WordPress Plugin. It's a simple and easy way to replace any sidebar/widget area in your WordPress theme without coding. This plugin integrates with the WordPress Customizer, so you can preview your custom widget areas on your site in realtime. Itâ€™s compatible with any theme and you can even replace more than one widget area on the same page!
