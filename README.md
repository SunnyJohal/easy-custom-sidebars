# Easy Custom Sidebars

Welcome to the Easy Custom Sidebars development repository.

## What is Easy Custom Sidebars?

Easy Custom Sidebars is a WordPress Plugin. It's a simple and easy way to replace any sidebar/widget area in your WordPress theme without coding. This plugin integrates with the WordPress Customizer, so you can preview your custom widget areas on your site in realtime. Itâ€™s compatible with any theme and you can even replace more than one widget area on the same page!

This repository is for development of a complete rewrite of this plugin. If you are looking to install and use this plugin on your WordPress website then please visit the official [Plugin Download Page](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/easy-custom-sidebars/), where the latest stable version is available to download.

## Getting Up and Running

We have a basic development environment that you can quickly get up and running with a few commands. First off, you will need to download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) package manager, if you don't have it already. After that, there are a few commands to run:

### Setup

Once you have cloned the repo run the command:

```sh
$ yarn setup
```

This simple command will:

- Install all node and composer dependancies.
- Run the `wp-env` plugin to setup a development env and spin up the relevant docker containers.

Once complete you should be able to visit [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to see the local test site.
